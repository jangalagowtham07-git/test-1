Bottleneck Analysis:  VUser's load : When I was running load test execution for 2000user's peak load, I have observed after 1200 user's Ramp up the application sever was crashed and all the transactions are getting failed and also we have observed server return  HTTP - 500(Internal Sever error) and HTTP - 503 (Service unavailable).  Root cause analysis:  Whenever I have identified the above issue, I monitored all the application server performance parameters finally I have identified JVM Heap is running out of Memory.  -Xms 512 MB (Initial size)  When I identified the above issue, I monitored JVM Heap Memory behavior and I observed available heap memory is getting down to zero.  So I have recommended to the development team to increase the maximum heap size.  So the development team has increased the maximum heap size to 4GB (4096 MB) and again I rerun the same test and no issues were observed.  During second time of execution we will be able to run peak load of 2000 user's successfully running on server.  Xmx 1024 MB (Maximum Size)
